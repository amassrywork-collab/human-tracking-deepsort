## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **real-time human tracking system** using **Deep Learning and Computer Vision** techniques.

The system is capable of:
- Detecting people in video streams
- Tracking multiple individuals across consecutive frames
- Assigning a **unique and stable ID** to each person
- Counting the total number of **unique persons** appearing in the video
- Visualizing results in real time with performance statistics

The project was developed as part of a **Deep Learning for Computer Vision** course and is designed to balance:
- Academic correctness
- Software engineering best practices
- Real-world applicability

## 🧠 Anatomy of the Human Tracking System

The following infographic provides a **high-level visual overview** of the complete Deep Learning pipeline used in this project.

It illustrates:
- Video input flow
- Person detection using YOLOv8
- Multi-object tracking with DeepSORT
- ID assignment and temporal consistency
- Unique person counting
- Final visual output
